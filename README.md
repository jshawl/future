# The Future of Browser History

We do not usually search for something that leads to a single result that answers our question, 
rather we search for terms and then explore the internet, connecting bits and pieces of the answer 
as we read through the web of tabs that our search starts for us.

Our browser’s history should reflect our behavior on the internet and help us understand the process behind it. It is crucial to actually understand and question the way we use the internet, and without the suitable tools, it is not possible.

## Solution
### Maps

On top there is a timeline, positions are still displayed chronologically, but users can also see connections.

Not only is this a different approach to browsing our own content, it is now possible to see patterns of my search queries and behaviors. In this way, our browser history does not only perform a retrieval function, but also writes a narrative.

### Searches

In order to re-create our experience — or to just see the overall topics of our interests — it would be useful to provide users with a list of past searches. Once you clicked a particular search result, it would expand with visited links based on that very query, and would redirect you to the map with the highlighted path.

### Analytics

Let’s say I already found what I was looking for and I’m satisfied with my information retrieval process.

How many times have I visited this website? How much time have I spent using it? When did I see something interesting? How often do I visit it? How does my generated traffic look like, from perspective of particular page?

It is crucial to be able to understand one’s own behavior, especially as there is no distinction between offline and online anymore. Filter Bubble shows that information we see is selective.

We live in times when understanding your browser behaviors and search patterns is becoming crucial in cognitivism process.

This is why we have set out to build this chrome extension to make all these ideas come to life.
